Clustering Analysis of responses to the Short Dark Triad Test

data here: https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/

The dark triad consists of narcissism, psychopathy, machiavellianism. These traits are measured by participants' rated answers to 27 questions.
I plotted the correlations on the answers for each trait, computed the principal components on all 27 answers and then performed a K means clustering.
